Learning to build NodeJS applications: Snake game for beginners
The purpose of this repository is for learning purposes with nodeJS applications and learning.
Built a replica of the old snake game using references and tutorials for learning purposes only and to create a free game to play on the web.

***Update****
As my knowledge grows I am incorporating everything I have learned, and have built the snake game on to my personalized website using HTML, CSS, and JS.
I have been working on a NFT project called, "SolCitizens".
SolCitizens are randomly generated pixel characters living on the Solana Network.  These creatures and citizens were created using an art engine( another project on my profile I build in my learning path) with layers of art to generate in to images of 10,000 characters.
Please come check the website out, which is still under construction.

In menu bar click on Snake, it will take you to the game.

Steps to play the game:
1. Click on the game with mouse.
2. Then start using the arrown on keyboard.
3. When game is over click on the reload page button on upper left of browser to restart game.
4.**** Game is still in works, the webpage may scroll up and down a little as you play*** Game is also not able to work with phones yet*** Check in for updates to the game.

Everything in website is being built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Hope the game is fun.
